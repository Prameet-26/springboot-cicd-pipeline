# 📌 Project Overview

This project demonstrates a production-style DevOps workflow for a Spring Boot application.

Whenever a developer pushes code to GitHub, Jenkins automatically performs the following tasks:

- Checkout Source Code
- Build Application
- Execute Unit Tests
- Static Code Analysis using SonarQube
- Build Docker Image
- Push Docker Image to Docker Hub

After deployment, the application is continuously monitored using:

- Spring Boot Actuator
- Micrometer
- Prometheus
- Grafana
- Alertmanager

This project simulates a real DevOps workflow commonly used in enterprise environments.

# ⚙ CI/CD Workflow

## Stage 1 — Checkout

Jenkins clones the latest code from the **dev** branch.

---

## Stage 2 — Build

```bash
./mvnw clean package
```

Compiles the application and generates the executable JAR.

---

## Stage 3 — Unit Testing

```bash
./mvnw test
```

Runs unit tests before creating the Docker image.

---

## Stage 4 — SonarQube Analysis

The application source code is analyzed for:

- Bugs
- Vulnerabilities
- Code Smells
- Security Hotspots
- Maintainability
- Code Duplication

---

## Stage 5 — Docker Image Build

```bash
docker build -t springboot-cicd .
```

Creates the Docker image.

---

## Stage 6 — Docker Login

Jenkins authenticates securely using stored Docker Hub credentials.

---

## Stage 7 — Docker Push

```bash
docker push prameet26/springboot-cicd:latest
```

Publishes the image to Docker Hub.

---

# 🐳 Docker

The application is packaged as a Docker container.

Benefits include:

- Consistent runtime
- Easy deployment
- Environment independence
- Versioned images
- Simplified scaling

---

# 🔍 SonarQube

Integrated with Jenkins to ensure code quality before deployment.

Checks include:

- Bugs
- Vulnerabilities
- Security Hotspots
- Maintainability Rating
- Code Smells
- Duplicated Code

---

# 📊 Monitoring Stack

## Spring Boot Actuator

Exposes application metrics.

```
/actuator/prometheus
```

---

## Micrometer

Collects JVM and application metrics.

Examples:

- CPU Usage
- Heap Memory
- Thread Count
- HTTP Requests
- Response Time

---

## Prometheus

Prometheus scrapes metrics from the application every few seconds.

---

## Grafana

Visualizes metrics using dashboards.

Dashboard Panels include:

- JVM Memory
- CPU Usage
- Request Count
- Response Time
- Application Health
- Uptime

---

## Alertmanager

Receives alerts from Prometheus.

Configured Alerts

- Spring Boot Application Down
- Instance Down

Notification Method

- Gmail SMTP Email

---

# 📦 Docker Hub Repository

```
Repository:
prameet26/springboot-cicd

Image Tag:
latest
```

Every successful Jenkins build pushes a fresh Docker image.

---

# 🛠 Challenges Faced

During this project, I encountered and resolved several real-world issues:

- Docker permission issues inside Jenkins
- Jenkins container unable to access Docker daemon
- Docker Hub authentication failures
- SonarQube connectivity configuration
- Prometheus scrape target configuration
- Grafana dashboard setup
- Alertmanager SMTP configuration
- Docker image build troubleshooting
- Jenkins pipeline debugging
- Git branch management

Resolving these issues improved my understanding of DevOps troubleshooting and CI/CD workflows.

---
